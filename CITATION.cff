abstract: >-
  REMERGE is a Multi-Word Expression (MWE) discovery
  algorithm, which started as a re-implementation and
  simplification of a similar algorithm called MERGE,
  detailed in a publication and Ph.D. thesis[1,2].
  The primary benefit of this algorithm is that it's
  non-parametric regarding the size of the n-grams
  that constitute an MWE—you do not need to specify a
  priori how many n-grams comprise an MWE—you only
  need to specify the number of iterations you want
  the algorithm to run.
